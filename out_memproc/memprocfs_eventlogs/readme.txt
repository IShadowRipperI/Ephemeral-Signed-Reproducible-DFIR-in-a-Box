Information about the eventlog module                                        
=====================================                                        
The eventlog module retrieves event log files.                               
                                                                             
It's recommended to copy the event logs to a separate folder before opening  
them, since the event viever will have issues opening them in the MemProcFS  
folder due to the lack of write support.                                     
                                                                             
Event log files may be partially corrupt and may have to be repaired with    
3rd party tools before being able to open.
